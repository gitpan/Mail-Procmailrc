Mail::Procmailrc version 1.04
=============================

Mail::Procmailrc is a pure Perl module that can read and write
procmail(1) compatible rc files. The intent behind its creation was
to provide an abstracted interface for web clients wishing to edit
procmailrc files, but it could be used in any number of useful ways
(e.g., a procmail rc pretty printer--how useful is that!?).

Mail::Procmailrc does not process mail in any form; it only reads and
writes procmail(1) rc files.

SAMPLE USAGE

    use Mail::Procmailrc;

    $pmrc = new Mail::Procmailrc("$HOME/.procmail/rc.spam");

    ## find the recipe we're looking for
    my $conditions;
    for my $recipe ( @{$pmrc->recipes} ) {
	next unless $recipe->info->[0] =~ /^\s*\#\# this recipe is for spam/io;
	$conditions = $recipe->conditions;
	last;
    }

    ## add another condition to this recipe
    push @$conditions, '* 1^0 this is not SPAM';

    ## write back out to disk
    $pmrc->flush;
